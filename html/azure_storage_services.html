Azure handles hardware maintenance, updates, and critical issues for you.</li><li>Accessible. Data in Azure Storage is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Microsoft provides client libraries for Azure Storage in a variety of languages, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, PHP, Ruby, Go, and others, as well as a mature REST API.</li><li>Azure Storage supports scripting in Azure PowerShell or Azure CLI.

This means you don't have to deal with patching the server OS with critical security upgrades or replacing faulty hard disks.</li><li>Scripting and tooling ==> PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI can be used to create, mount, and manage Azure file shares as part of the administration of Azure applications. You can create and manage Azure file shares using Azure portal and Azure Storage Explorer.</li><li>Resiliency ==> Azure Files has been built from the ground up to always be available. Replacing on-premises file shares with Azure Files means you don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to deal with local power outages or network issues.</li><li>Familiar programmability ==> Applications running in Azure can access data in the share via file system I/O APIs. Developers can therefore leverage their existing code and skills to migrate existing applications. In addition to System IO APIs, you can use Azure Storage Client Libraries or the Azure Storage REST API.</li><tr align= left><th>Queue storage</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages</li><li>Once stored, you can access the messages from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS.</li><li>Each individual message can be up to 64 KB in size</li><li>Queues are commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.</li><li>Queue storage can be combined with compute functions like Azure Functions to take an action when a message is received</li><tr align= left><th>Disk storage</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>Disk storage, or Azure managed disks, are block-level storage volumes managed by Azure for use with Azure VMs.</li></table><a href='../index.html'>Back to topics</a>
