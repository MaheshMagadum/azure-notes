You can be alerted when your database storage is getting too low, or when network latency is about to reach unacceptable levels.</li><li>Static metric alerts are based on simple static conditions and thresholds that you define. With static metrics, you specify the threshold that will be used to trigger the alert or notification.</li><li>Dynamic metric alerts use machine-learning tools that Azure provides to automatically improve the accuracy of the thresholds defined by the initial rule.</li><tr align= left><th>Use log alerts to alert on events in your application</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>You can use Azure Monitor to capture important information from log files. These log files can be created by applications, operating systems, other hardware, or Azure services.</li><li>Log alerts use log data to assess the rule logic and, if necessary, trigger an alert.</li><li>Consider using the number-of-records type of log search when you're working with an event or event-driven data. Examples are syslog and web-app responses.</li><li>One of the primary considerations when you're evaluating the use of log alerts is that they're stateless (stateful log alerts are currently in preview). A stateless log alert will generate new alerts every time the rule criteria are triggered, regardless of whether the alert was previously recorded.</li><tr align= left><th>Use activity log alerts to alert on events within your Azure infrastructure</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>Activity log alerts allow you to be notified when a specific event happens on some Azure resource. For example, you can be notified when someone creates a new VM in a subscription.</li><li>There are two types of activity log alerts</li><li>Specific operations => Applies to resources within your Azure subscription, and often has a scope with specific resources or a resource group. For example, you can receive an alert if a VM is deleted or new roles are assigned to a user.</li><li>Service health events => Include notice of incidents and maintenance of target resources.</li></table><a href='../index.html'>Back to topics</a>
