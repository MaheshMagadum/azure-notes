External firewalls identify traffic originating from your virtual network by the IP address.</li><li>Built-in high availability ==> With Azure Firewall, you gain built-in high availability without any extra configuration requirements.</li><li>Availability zones ==> Configure Azure Firewall during deployment to span multiple availability zones for increased availability.</li><li>Unrestricted cloud scalability ==> Azure Firewall offers unrestricted cloud scalability to scale as needed to accommodate changing network traffic flows</li><li>Application FQDN filtering rules ==> Azure Firewall lets you limit outbound HTTP/S traffic or Azure SQL traffic to a specified list of fully qualified domain names (FQDN) including wild cards</li><li>Network traffic filtering rules ==> Create network filtering rules in Azure Firewall to allow or deny traffic by source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.</li><li>Threat intelligence ==> Configure your firewall to alert and deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains.The IP addresses and domains are sourced from the Microsoft Threat Intelligence feed.</li><li>Azure Monitor integration ==> Azure Firewall is fully integrated with Azure Monitor for logging and analytics</li><tr align= left><th>Create Azure Firewall Implementation</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>Consider cost savings. Implement a hub-spoke network and reduce your costs by centralizing services that can be shared by multiple workloads in a single location</li><li>Examples of services that can use shareable workloads include network virtual appliances (NVAs) and DNS servers.</li><li>Consider subscription limits. Overcome subscription limits by peering your virtual networks from different subscriptions to the central hub network.</li><li>Consider role separation. Use a hub-spoke network configuration to support separation of responsibilities. The hub-spoke firewall topology lets you distribute maintenance tasks between central IT (SecOps, InfraOps) and workloads (DevOps).</li><li>Consider shared services. Support workloads in different environments that require shared services, but not connectivity to each other.</li><li>Examples of these environments include development and testing where each requires DNS. Place shared services in the hub virtual network, and deploy each environment to a spoke to maintain isolation.</li><li>Consider centralized control. Apply the hub-spoke network for enterprises that require central control over security aspects.</li><li>A common example is a firewall located in the hub and workloads placed in each spoke.</li><tr align= left><th>Create Azure Firewall rules</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>By default, Azure Firewall denies all traffic through your virtual network.</li><li>The purpose of the default behavior is to provide the highest level of protection against malicious or unknown access.</li><li>Order how rules are processed by Azure Firewall -> first Network rules, second Application rules (for the network and applications)</li><li>After a packet is allowed, Azure Firewall checks for NAT rules that define how to route the allowed traffic.</li><tr align= left><th>NAT fules</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>You can configure NAT or Azure Firewall destination network address translation (DNAT) rules to translate and filter inbound traffic to your subnets</li><li>Each rule in your NAT rule collection is used to translate your firewall public IP and port to a private IP and port.</li><li>A NAT rule that routes traffic must be accompanied by a matching network rule to allow the traffic.</li><li>Scenarios where NAT rules can be helpful are publishing SSH, RDP, or non-HTTP/S applications to the internet.</li><tr align= left><th>Lear these</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>What to know about Network rules/Application rules</li><tr align= left><th>Questions</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>What type of Azure Firewall rule can allow access to Azure SQL Database from an FQDN address? ==> Application rule</li><li>Which feature does Azure Firewall use to enable remote desktop connections? ==> Destination network address translation (DNAT)</li><li>How would you describe the IP address for an Azure Firewall implementation? ==> A firewall has a statically assigned public IP address</li></table><a href='../index.html'>Back to topics</a>
