This feature helps you identify if a security rule is blocking traffic to or from your virtual machine or the internet.</li><li>ex. The feature tests communication for a target virtual machine with associated network security group (NSG) rules by running inbound and outbound packets to and from the machine.</li><li>After the test runs complete, the feature informs you whether communication with the machine succeeds (allows access) or fails (denies access).</li><li>If the target machine denies the packet because of an NSG, the feature returns the name of the controlling security rule.</li><li>The IP flow verify feature is ideal for helping to ensure correct application of your security rules</li><li>At some point, your virtual machine might be unable to communicate with other resources because of a security rule. You can use the IP flow verify feature to troubleshoot your NSG rules.</li><tr align= left><th>Review next hop diagnostics</th></ul></td></tr><td><ul><li>The next hop feature in Azure Network Watcher checks if traffic is being directed to the intended destination.
